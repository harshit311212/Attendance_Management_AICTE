# Facial Recognition Attendance System

This project implements a facial recognition attendance system using Python. It allows users to register new faces, recognize them in real-time, and log attendance based on facial recognition. The system provides a user-friendly interface for managing attendance records.

## Project Structure

- **main.py**: This script is used to register new faces and capture images.
- **attendance_taker.py**: This script recognizes faces, trains the model, and logs attendance for the current date.
- **app.py**: This application allows users to view their attendance records by selecting a specific date.
- **resources/**: This directory contains the necessary Dlib binary `.whl` files required to install Dlib for the project.
- **requirements.txt**: A file listing all the necessary Python packages and their versions required to run the project.

## Features

- **Face Registration**: Users can register new faces by capturing images through the webcam.
- **Real-Time Recognition**: The system can recognize registered faces in real-time and log attendance.
- **Attendance Logging**: Attendance is recorded with timestamps for each recognized face.
- **View Attendance Records**: Users can view their attendance records by selecting a date.
